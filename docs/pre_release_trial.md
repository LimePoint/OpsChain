# OpsChain pre-release trial

Everyone has a combination of toolchains, and keeping track of changes and determining the state across a mix of DevOps tools is _HARD_. OpsChain is here to help!

OpsChain is a platform whose sole purpose is to _Unify Change_ - connect, automate, and orchestrate people, processes, and tools across your on-premise and cloud platforms.

## Getting started

Keen to get started? We have a [getting started guide](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-trial/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md) which lists technical requirements and helps you to get going. You will also find several examples of using OpsChain with [Terraform](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-terraform), [Ansible](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-ansible), [Confluent](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-confluent) and [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/LimePoint/opschain-examples-vault) to try out.

### Trial licence

We aim to complete the prerelease trial phase by the end of 2021 so we will provide you with a 3-month licence. This licence will allow you to use all of the OpsChain features without limitation. If you are interested in using OpsChain beyond the trial, please get in touch with us at [opschain@limepoint.com](mailto:opschain@limepoint.com).

### Frequency of OpsChain releases

As the trial progresses you can expect further releases of OpsChain. New releases may contain new features/enhancements to try out or bug fixes. Don’t worry though, you don’t need to update every time.

Keep an eye out in the _#opschain-trial_ Slack channel for notifications of new releases.

## We love feedback

We want to encourage you to try out OpsChain. Try out the examples and see how you could take advantage of OpsChain as part of your activities. In exchange, we are seeking your feedback to help us improve OpsChain even further :-).

We want to hear from you; the good, the bad, and the ugly. All feedback is welcome and cherished. Tell us what you think works well, what are you unsure about, what couldn’t you do, what do you wish it could do?

As an added bonus, the first 25 participants to provide feedback will also receive an exclusive limited release OpsChain T-shirt. Get on board and grab some merch.

### How to lodge feedback

We want to know your impressions and thoughts throughout the trial. So don’t wait until the end of the trial.

You can reach us via Slack on the #opschain-trial channel or send us an email at [opschain@limepoint.com](mailto:opschain@limepoint.com).

### Surveys

You can also expect a survey or two along the way; don’t worry, we won’t spam you or hassle you. But we do ask for your participation to help us determine general trends for us to focus on.

### Help! Who to contact for support

We are based in Melbourne, Australia so typically, responses would be local business hours.

If you encounter issues or have questions, send us an email at [opschain@limepoint.com](mailto:opschain@limepoint.com). Please include a description of what you are trying to do and what issues/errors you are encountering. Also, attach any relevant screenshots and OpsChain logfiles.

Any defects raised will be triaged, and where possible, we will provide a workaround to bypass the issue. If it is a showstopper, we may also provide a bug fix or release that addresses the issue.

### What other features are coming

This pre-release trial version of OpsChain is an early preview of OpsChain’s capability. On our roadmap, we have many more features and capabilities to come, including:

- graphical user interface - a web browser interface to allow you to interact with OpsChain
- manual intervention - support for manual approvals of step/action
